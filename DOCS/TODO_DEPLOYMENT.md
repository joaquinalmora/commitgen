4. **Git Workflow**: Hooks properly integrated with prepare-commit-msg
5. **Configuration**: Environment-based config with smart defaults
6. **Architecture**: Clean modular design with provider interface
7. **Error Recovery**: Fallback chain (AI → Cache → Heuristics)

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Attention
1. **Distribution**: No automated releases or package management
2. **Testing**: Limited test coverage (3/8 packages)
3. **Legal**: Missing LICENSE file
4. **Build Tools**: No Makefile or build automation
5. **Documentation**: Missing several standard files
6. **Dependencies**: No .env.example (breaks setup.sh)

## 🎯 Recommended Launch Sequence

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Release (1-2 days)
1. Add LICENSE file
2. Create .env.example
3. Add basic Makefile
4. Expand test coverage to 5/8 packages

### Phase 2: Production Infrastructure (3-4 days)  
1. Setup GoReleaser + GitHub Actions
2. Create Homebrew tap
3. Add comprehensive CI/CD
4. Complete testing coverage

### Phase 3: Polish & Documentation (2-3 days)
1. Add CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
2. Improve error messages
3. Enhanced observability
4. Interactive setup command

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-9 days for production-ready launch
